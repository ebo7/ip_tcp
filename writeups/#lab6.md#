My name: [Erdenebold Battulga]

My SUNet ID: [ebo2020]

Program Structure and Design of the Router:
[

Implementation Challenges:
[
Wasn't sure at first whether all nodes and not just leaf nodes should store hop information.
Was on a wrong track and wondered how to get the most recent node with valid data in case the route prefix only
partially matches with an ip down the tree.
Had problem with pointers, dereferencing, implementing BST and returning root of BST.
